My name is Charlize Rodriguez, I am 18 years old and I am a first year architecture student at NJIT. I am in computer programming and graphics class and I am completeing my third lab. This is my brief introductory text. One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music and going to the movies with my cousins. It is a good way to relieve stress and a great way to have fun
